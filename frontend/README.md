# SkyShelf Frontend 

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** : [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note**: If `npm` is not installed, it is included with Node.js. Installing Node.js will automatically install `npm`.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from the remote source to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chqwater/SkyShelf.git
```

Navigate into the project directory, enter the frontend directory:

```bash
cd SkyShelf
cd frontend
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required packages listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.<br>
